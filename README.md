## Problem Statement
Over the last few years, South-America has become a popular traveling destination for many backpackers. Historical relics, architectural and natural wonders, a diverse range of foods and culture, vibrant and colorful cities, and stunning landscapes attract millions of tourists every year to South America. Because of widespread and diverse wonders South-America has to over, it might be hard and overwelming to plan your trip. There is lack of a clear overview and a suggestion on the best route for a backpacker that is dreaming of an adventure through South-America.

## Solution

This visualisation is going to be an interactive map of a popular route through South-America. This maps allows for interactive information on clicking a city / place on the route. The information will help a traveller make a desicion on the best time to visit the city, how much money to bring and how touristy the place is.
